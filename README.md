Algorithms which classify based on spatial and spectral characteristics of data are not well suited to
capture the temporal information present in the data. For applications like flood monitoring, which shows great seasonal
variation, mutli temporal classification algorithms are best suited. Advances in deep learning algorithms like Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) , Gated Recurrent Units (GRU),Neural Turing Machines (NTM) shows
great promise in processing sequences of temporal remote sensing data. Along with traditional shape, texture and color
features, a better representation of features can be obtained by training a traditional convolutional neural network
(CNN). These features can be further used to train a RNN which better models the multi-temporal nature of the phenomena
being studied.  The time required for training can be substantially reduced using smart faster algorithms for
convolution operations and matrix multiplication and also by using high performance computing facilities. The main
objective of this research is to use deep learning technologies to improve classification accuracy for flood monitoring
which is infact a geospatial phenomena showing temporal variations
